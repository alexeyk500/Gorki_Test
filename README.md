You need locally installed Docker,
if you have Docker on your local machine:

1) clone the project by command $git clone https://github.com/alexeyk500/Gorki_Test.git
2) go to the project folder by command $cd gorki_test
3) build and start project by command $docker-compose up -d

The Gorki_Test will start on your browser on http://localhost
